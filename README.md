# My Age Assignment
## Background information: 
Read this information on [**Variables**](https://github.com/Athenian-Computer-Science/my-age-assignment-template/blob/master/variables.md) before beginning the exercise.


## Problem Description
In this assignment, you are tasked with modifying 4 different functions to give the user's age now, in 1 year, in 10 years and in 50 years. The goal is for you to practice working with variables and print statements. Take care when modifying the starter code - read the comments carefully so you know what to change and what to leave alone.


## Example
```
Current age? 14
Age now = 14
Age next year = 15
Age in 10 years = 24
Age in 50 years = 54

```

## Suggested Approach
1) Note the function parameters in parentheses. Those hold the value of the current age.
2) You will need to calculate the age requested in each function. You can decide where/how to do that.


## Hints
* Use the section under `if __name__ == '__main__': ` to change arguments and check your work.
* When you are happy with your code, use `input()` to prompt the user for a value.
* Add code to [my_code.py](./my_code.py) to make it do the desired thing.
* Run your code with: `python my_code.py` or the run button
* Run your tests with: `pytest`
